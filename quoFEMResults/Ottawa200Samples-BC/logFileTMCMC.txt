Finished reading in calibration data. Shape of calibration data: (1, 6)

The number of experiments: 1
The number of calibration terms per experiment: 6
Computing normalizing factors. The normalizing factors used are the absolute maximum of the data for each response variable. The data and the prediction will be divided by the normalizing factors.
Normalized calibration data: 
[[1.         0.80769231 0.5        0.19230769 0.15384615 0.11538462]]
The normalizing factors computed are: 
EDP: nCycles, normalizing factor: 26.0

The locShift values are: 
EDP: nCycles, locShift: 0.0

==========================
Processing options for variance/covariance:
One variance value or covariance matrix will be used per response quantity per experiment.
If the user does not supply variance or covariance data, a default variance value will be
used per response quantity, which is constant across experiments. The default variance is
computed as the variance of the normalized data, if there is data from more than one experiment. 
If there is data from only one experiment, then a default variance value is computed by 
assuming that the standard deviation of the error is 5% of the absolute maximum value of 
the corresponding normalized response data.

Looping over the experiments and EDPs

Experiment number: 1
	EDP: nCycles
		Checking to see if user-supplied file 'nCycles.1.sigma' exists in 'C:/Users/adith/Documents/OttawaF65QF'
		Did not find a user supplied file. Using the default variance value.
		The covariance matrix is an identity matrix multiplied by this value.
		Covariance matrix: 0.0025000000000000005
